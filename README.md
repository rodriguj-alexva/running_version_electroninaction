# running_version_electroninaction

My version of the code from the book "Electron in Action" as I found I had to make lots of changes to make it work.

I don't understand how there are so many (around 6 to 8) differences in API etc. by chapter 6 that prevent the sample code to work. Hopefully someone will find this useful.

Plus given the huge amoount of time spent searching for fixes, I decided to slightly rewrite the code to my style.
